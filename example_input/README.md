# example_input
This directory contains example input files for use with ConeZen, a Python toolkit for computational chemists to analyze and visualize conical intersection topology.

## Purpose
The files in this directory serve as demonstration input data for:

- Testing ConeZenâ€™s API and command-line interface
- Reproducing examples from the documentation and paper
- Helping new users get started quickly
  
 ## File Descriptions
- S0_gradient.out: Example gradient vector file for S0 (format: N x 3, plain text)
- S1_gradient.out: Example gradient vector file for S1 (format: N x 3, plain text)
- NAC_S0_S1.out: Example nonadiabatic coupling (NAC) vector file (format: N x 3, plain text)
- 
  ## Notes
All files are for demonstration and testing only. Replace with your quantum chemistry output files for real analysis.
File format: Each file should be a plain text file, with one row per atom and three columns (x, y, z components).
