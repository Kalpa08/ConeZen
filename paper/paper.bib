abstract  ="Over the last few decades{,} conical intersections (CoIns) have grown from theoretical curiosities into common mechanistic features of photochemical reactions{,} whose function is to funnel electronically excited molecules back to their ground state in regions where the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of two electronic states become degenerate. Analogous to transition states in thermal chemistry{,} CoIns appear as transient structures providing a kinetic bottleneck along a reaction coordinate. However{,} such a bottleneck is not associated with the probability of crossing an energy barrier but rather with an excited state decay probability along a full “line” of transient structures connected by non-reactive modes{,} the intersection space (IS). This article will review our understanding of the factors controlling CoIn mediated ultrafast photochemical reactions{,} taking a physical organic chemist approach by discussing a number of case studies for small organic molecules and photoactive proteins. Such discussion will be carried out by first introducing the “standard” one-mode model based on Landau–Zener (LZ) theory to describe a reactive excited state decay event intercepting{,} locally{,} a single CoIn along a single direction{,} and then by providing a modern perspective based on the effects of the phase matching of multiple modes on the same local event{,} thus redefining and expanding the description of the excited state reaction coordinate. The direct proportionality between the slope (or velocity) along one mode and decay probability at a single CoIn is a widely applied fundamental principle that follows from the LZ model{,} yet it fails to provide a complete understanding of photochemical reactions whose local reaction coordinate changes along the IS. We show that in these situations{,} in particular by focussing on rhodopsin double bond photoisomerization{,} it is mandatory to consider additional molecular modes and their phase relationship approaching the IS{,} hence providing a key mechanistic principle of ultrafast photochemistry based on the phase matching of those modes. We anticipate that this qualitative mechanistic principle should be considered in the rational design of any ultrafast excited state process{,} impacting various fields of research ranging from photobiology to light-driven molecular devices."}

abstract = {We review the Surface Hopping including ARbitrary Couplings (SHARC) approach for excited-state nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. As a generalization of the popular surface hopping method, SHARC allows simulating the full-dimensional dynamics of molecules including any type of coupling terms beyond nonadiabatic couplings. Examples of these arbitrary couplings include spin–orbit couplings or dipole moment–laser field couplings, such that SHARC can describe ultrafast internal conversion, intersystem crossing, and radiative processes. The key step of the SHARC approach consists of a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian including these couplings, such that the nuclear dynamics is carried out on potential energy surfaces including the effects of the couplings—this is critical in any applications considering, for example, transition metal complexes or strong laser fields. We also give an overview over the new SHARC2.0 dynamics software package, released under the GNU General Public License, which implements the SHARC approach and several analysis tools. The review closes with a brief survey of applications where SHARC was employed to study the nonadiabatic dynamics of a wide range of molecular systems.

abstract  ="Chemiexcitation{,} the generation of electronic excited states by a thermal reaction initiated on the ground state{,} is an essential step in chemiluminescence{,} and it is mediated by the presence of a conical intersection that allows a nonadiabatic transition from ground state to excited state. Conical intersections classified as sloped favor chemiexcitation over ground state relaxation. The chemiexcitation yield of 1{,}2-dioxetanes is known to increase upon methylation. In this work we explore to which extent this trend can be attributed to changes in the conical intersection topography or accessibility. Since conical intersections are not isolated points{,} but continuous seams{,} we locate regions of the conical intersection seams that are close to the configuration space traversed by the molecules as they react on the ground state. We find that conical intersections are energetically and geometrically accessible from the reaction trajectory{,} and that topographies favorable to chemiexcitation are found in all three molecules studied. Nevertheless{,} the results suggest that dynamic effects are more important for explaining the different yields than the static features of the potential energy surfaces."}
