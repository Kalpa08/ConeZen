## ðŸ“‚ Example Output

This folder contains example output files generated using **ConeZen**:

- `static_image.png` â€“ a publication-quality static 3D plot of the conical intersection branching plane.
- `conical_intersection_rotation.gif` â€“ an animated rotation of the same plot for presentations.
- `conical_intersection_rotation.mp4` â€“ the same animation in high-resolution video format.

Use these as a reference for what to expect when you run your own CI visualization.

### **Note** My original CI will be updated after publishing my upcoming paper, if you need it then mail me at 20jyotikalpa15@gmail.com
