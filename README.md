## Overview

**ConeZen** is an open-source Python tool for visualizing the branching plane topology near a conical intersection (CI).  
It processes nonadiabatic coupling (NAC) and gradient data from **SHARC–OpenMolcas** to generate high-quality, publication-ready 3D plots and animations for computational chemistry applications.
